## Description 

Cafe Clicker is a cookie clicker/AdVenture Capitalist click game. You sign up/log in and are presented with the main screen for the game. To play, all you do is click the avocado and you'll gain points. Earning enough points will allow you to buy the "AutoClicker" and "MultiClicker" powerups. Their price is shown next to them respectively.

Scrolling down will show you your cafe. You own a cafe and want to expand it! The more points you earn for the cafe, the more things you get to add to it. When you reach a milestone, you'll be shown a notification letting you know your cafe has been updated. Your cafe will expand a lot, so be sure to earn a bunch of points. Once you're at a good level, you can submit your score to the leaderboard and check back on it later to see how far you've come.

If you need to save your progress, you can click the save game button and come back later using the load game button. If you want to restart, all you have to do is click the new game button and you'll be set back to square one.
